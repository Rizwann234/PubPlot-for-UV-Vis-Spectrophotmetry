# PubPlot-for-UV-Vis-Spectrophotmetry
Automated UV-Visible Absorbance Spectra plotting.

## Section 1 - Motivation

During my time as an undergraduate and then postgraduate student, I hated plotting and formatting graphs in excel. Alas my interest in programming came after doing a masters in chemistry. 

The motivation of this project thus came from what I wished I could haved automated during my time as a university student. The pedantic nature of academia means that your graphs have to be on point and therefore one could spend a good few minutes plotting and formatting your graphs. Therefore the objective of this program is to automate this process by simply speicfying the filepaths and plot parameters.

If you happen to come accross this repository, feel free to download the code. Any constructive feedback on the code and the user experience would be much
appreciated.

## Section 2 - Instructions for use

Before using this code, it would be beneficial to have these downloaded if not already.

- Python, it is often better to install directly from the python website.  
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Dependencies : pandas, numpy, matplotlib

If you do not have these already, copy and paste these lines into your command line.

python -m pip install -U matplotlib  
python -m pip install -U pandas  
python -m pip install -U numpy  

**Step 1** : Open the software with the following line - python "[filepath of the python code you have saved.]"
         alternatively you can write "python"  then drag and drop the .py file into the command line.
