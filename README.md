# PubPlot-for-UV-Vis-Spectrophotmetry
Automated UV-Visible Absorbance Spectra plotting.

## Section 1 - Motivation
During my time as an undergraduate and then postgraduate student, I hated plotting and formatting graphs in excel. Alas my interest in programming came after
doing a masters in chemistry. The motivation of this project thus came from what I wished I could haved automated during my time as a university student. 
The pedantic nature of academia means that your graphs have to be on point and therefore one could spend a good few minutes plotting and formatting your graphs. Therefore the objective of this program is to automate this process by simply speicfying the filepaths and plot parameters.

If you happen to come accross this repository, feel free to download the code. Any constructive feedback on the code and the user experience would be much
appreciated.
